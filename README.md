# 🌿 Trio-Trashy: Real Waste Classification System with Machine Learning 

**Using Machine Learning to automatically classify waste into recyclable categories, promoting sustainability and efficient recycling.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Trio-Trashy: Real Waste Classification System** addresses the growing challenge of improper waste disposal by providing a smart, affordable, and scalable solution. Using a simple webcam and a deep learning model, the system can identify waste items in **nine categories**:

# --- Waste Labels ---
- 0: 🔁 Cardboard
- 1: 🍌 Food Organics
- 2: 🧪 Glass
- 3: 🪙 Metal 
- 4: 🤖 Miscellaneous Trash
- 5: 📰 Paper  
- 6: 🥫 Plastic 
- 7: 🔋 Textile Trash
- 8: 🌱 Vegetation

# --- Dustbin Labels ---
- 0 = Recyclable
- 1 = Hazardous
- 2 = Food
- 3 = Residual

The model is trained using image data and deployed with **TensorFlow Lite** for real-time classification, all running on **low-cost consumer devices** without special hardware. 
The project promotes proper recycling, reduces pollution, and supports a cleaner environment.

## 👥 End Users:

Our system is designed to benefit:

- 🏠 Households and individuals  
- 🏫 Schools and colleges  
- 🏙️ Municipal corporations / local authorities  
- ♻️ Recycling centers  
- 🌿 Environmental NGOs and green startups  

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

Our mission is to bring **Real waste classification** to the masses using accessible, everyday tools like webcams and mobile devices. By enabling better waste sorting at the source, we hope to:

- 🗑️ Reduce landfill overflow  
- 🔄 Improve recycling efficiency  
- 🌍 Lower pollution and environmental damage  
- 💡 Educate and empower communities  
- 🧩 Support smart city and green initiatives  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Trio-Trashy** shows that **Machine Learning based waste segregation is not just possible, but practical**. By using **transfer learning** and **TensorFlow Lite**, we built a system that runs efficiently in **real-time** on common devices. It encourages **public participation**, can be **easily scaled in low-resource regions**, and supports **sustainable living**.

This project merges **technology** and **ecology** — making smart waste disposal an everyday reality.
